Common Lisp Sphinx Search API client
===========

See docs in `doc/`


### UNFINISHED & UNTESTED

This is a rather blunt port of the perl API found on CPAN, at
[Sphinx-Search-0.22](http://search.cpan.org/~jjschutz/Sphinx-Search-0.22/).

It is mostly unfinished (the only done parts are descibed in the
documentation found in `doc/`), and most definitely **untested**. So
use at your own risk.


### ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

This port is based on Sphinx.pm version 0.22 (deployed to CPAN
[here](http://search.cpan.org/~jjschutz/Sphinx-Search-0.22/)), which
itself says:

    This module is based on Sphinx.pm (not deployed to CPAN) for
    Sphinx version 0.9.7-rc1, by Len Kranendonk, which was in turn
    based on the Sphinx PHP API.

Also used was the api for python which was supplied with the source code
download for Sphinx Search v0.9.9-rc2, in the `api/` directory.
